## Evaluation criteria
Define and write one manual end-to-end test cases which will be automated in next
steps.

These are some aspects we pay particular attention to:
- You can use any language/framework you are most comfortable with.
- Your solution must be independent of a particular OS.
- Your solution must support running tests in parallel.
- Your solution must support two different browsers.
- You must provide instructions on how to run the tests and any installation prerequisites.
- The tests in the provided solution must pass consistently and follow the initial steps.

Nice to have:
- The code should be documented and be easy-to-follow.
- The solution should be well structured.
